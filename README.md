# dotscad.things

This module contains everything in dotscad that just doesn't fit anywhere else.

Each Thing is organized into its own directory, where you will find the necessary
.scad file(s) along with the README, a rendered STL file which you can interact
examime directly in github, and possibly a photo of the printed item.
